Pancake Mahjong is an inofficial Saki mahjong simulator
with high-quality occult implementation.

## Build

The client can be built on Linux, Windows, or macOS with
Qt (community version) installed, 
The least required version is Qt 5.7, 
but it is recommended to use the lastest Qt 5.13
to obtain a probably better performance.
The target platform can be Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, or iOS. 

To obtain an executable client,
open `mjpancake.pro` with Qt Creator and just build it.
